This is a repo decumenting my journey experimenting with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). This is nothing serious, just pure exploration
and feeding my thirst for knowledge (or curiosity). Having already worked extensively with angular (and contributed to the community via [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5927361/kisinga?tab=profile)), I hope to make a rough comparison between the two _frameworks_.  
I love angular, BTW  

# Getting started
Make sure you have node and npm installed  
clone the repo
cd into the repo
run `npm i`  
run `npm run start`  
open your browser and point it to the address provided in the terminal. It something like ` http://localhost:33229`, but the port changes  
Is it a framework? Is is a compiler? Is it both? To find out I started with [this temmplate](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).
I am using a nice set of [youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hlbrVO_2QFVqVPhlZmz7tO) by "The Net Ninja"

# Impressions (Mostly in Comparison to Angular)
**Day 1**  
It rebuilds instantly on save. Maybe this is more related to rollup, but still, I dig  
**Day 3**  
Coming from angular, its hilarious how familiar this is. The syntax is definitely different, but so far I find it more expressive  
**Day ... I lost count**  
No built-in form valudation. Dang!
