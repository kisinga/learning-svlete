This is a repo decumenting my journey experimenting with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). This is nothing serious, just pure exploration
and feeding my thirst for knowledge (or curiosity). Having already worked extensively with angular (and contributed to the community via [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5927361/kisinga?tab=profile)), I hope to make a rough comparison between the two _frameworks_.  
I love angula, BTW  
Is it a framework? Is is a compiler? Is it both? To find out I started with [this temmplate](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).
I am using a nice set of [youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hlbrVO_2QFVqVPhlZmz7tO) by "The Net Ninja"
